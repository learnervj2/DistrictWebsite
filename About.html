<h3  style="color:white">Thiruvannamalai History</h3><br>
<h5 style="color:white">Tiruvannamalai City Under  Hoysala Kingdom</h5><br>
<p  style="color:white">Tiruvannamalai is an ancient city exists since 8th Century. Ellappa Nayanar the Sixteenth century Tamil scholar,  recorded extensively about Tiruvannamalai town in his Arunachala Puranam tamil literature work. There is an Sansksrit literature work called Arunachala Mahatmyam written in same period.  But there is  known controversey among Sanskirit and Tamil scholoars, in claiming  which literature is written first about tiruvannamalai history. Unlike Sanskirt version, ancient Tamil scholoar Ellappa Nayanar's has extensively recorded about the Tiruvannamalai City architecture and the legendary stories about  King Vallalan the Hoysala empire. The king  has contributed in spreading the benefit of Girivalam and Arunachala temple. Which Subsequently  helped the expansion of  Tiruvannamalai town.  King Vallala was ruling entire south india from Deccan Plateu with Dwarasamdura as capital. Now called Halebid lay to the north-west of Mysore. We can still see the richness of Hoysala art, architecture and its unique style distinguished by a high density of details and embellishments, among the remains of city Halebid.
Till then history of Tiruvannamalai can be sporadically tracked among Chozha, Pandiya Tamil literature work ranging period from 6th century to 8th century. The eldest script would be 6th century tamil script written on Madurai Meenakshi Temple wall, referring grandfather of Madurai meeta Sundara pandiyan (Who liberated Madurai from Kaalee ruler)  Kulesekara Pandiyan II. In the script, Tiruvannamalai and  has been  mentioned as Thiruvanangum Malai  as part of Madurai kingdom, . As we know the enormous details of Tiruvannamalai History began appearing only after Ellappa Nayinar's Arunachala Puranam.

<h5  style="color:white">King Vallalan Founder of Tiruvannamalai Town</h5><br>
<p  style="color:white">King Vallalan's devotion and piety are celebrated in chapter seven of the Arunachala Purananam, written in sixteenth century by Ellapa Nayinar. The work is based on the Arunachala Mahatmyam, written several centuries before in Sansksrit, but the chapter dealing with King Vallalan and his exploits in Tiruvannamalaai can only be found in the Tamil version. To find out why he is so revered in Tiruvannamalali, and indeed, why he was in Tirvannamalai at all, it is necessary to go back a few years and give an account of his family history. 
Tiruvanamalai History in Arunachala Puranam
 King Vallala succeeded his father Narasimha later expanded his territory upto Tiruvannamalai by taking over his father brother's kingdom on 31st January ,1292. He was thirty years old when he crowned as king.  Later he lost most of his ruling territory to Delhi Sultan Ala-u-din Khaliji shrinked to south and kept the Tiruvannamalai as one of his capital. Since then the Grace of Arunachala spread all over india and Tiruvannamalai become main spot for spiritual Pilgrims.

<p class="text-center" style="color:white">(Parts of this article were first published in The Mountain Path, 1990, pp. 64-71)
</p><br>
<p  style="color:white">King Vira Vallalan III was an illustrious king who ruled over the Hoysala empire from 1292 till 1342. At its peak it covered a large part of South India. Its traditional stronghold was the southern part of the Deccan plateau where the capital city Dwarasamudra was located. The city, nowadays reduced to a very small town called Halebid, lay to the north-west of Mysore. Though now ruined and abandoned, the old city contains the finest examples of Hoysala art and architecture, a unique style distinguished by a high density of details and embellishments. When times were good and neighbouring kingdoms were weak, the Hoysala empire covered most of modern-day Karnataka, northern Andhra Pradesh, and a good portion of northern Tamil Nadu. 

     King Vallalan's devotion and piety are celebrated in chapter seven of the Arunachala Purananam, a Tamil poetical work that was written in the sixteenth century by Ellapa Nayinar.</p>
	  <p style="color:white"> The work is based on the Arunachala Mahatmyam, written several centuries before in Sansksrit, but the chapter dealing with King Vallalan and his exploits in Tiruvannamalaai can only be found in the Tamil version. To find out why he is so revered in Tiruvannamalali, and indeed, why he was in Tirvannamalai at all, it is necessary to go back a few years and give an account of his family history. 
     King Vallalan's grandfather, Someswara, ruled the empire from 1233-67. At the beginning of his reign he recaptured territory lost by the previous king, extended his kingdom northwards as far as Pandharpur in Maharashtra, and endowed the famous Vittal Temple there. In the later years of his reign both his northern and southern territories were attacked by neighbouring kingdoms. The resurgent Pandya kings of Madurai, in particular Sundara Pandya, took over much of his Tamil territory, including Tiruvannamalai, which was then part of a territory known as Magada. This covered most of the old, undivided North Arcot District, along with a small portion of South Arcot. Towards the end of his life Someswara divided his kingdom between his two sons: Narasimha received the northern territories and the capital city Dwarasamdura, while Ramanatha was given the diminished southern ones whose chief city was Kannanur, located about fifteen miles north of Tiruchirappalli. The Pandya King Kulasekara, based in Madurai, captured most of Ramanatha's Tamil territories in 1279, forcing him north. Ramanatha then tried to take some of his brother's territories by force, but only succeeded in capturing a few districts in the Bangalore area.
